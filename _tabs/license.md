# Obscuria Ecosystem License (OEL)

-----

Obscuria projects are distributed under a custom community-focused license designed to support a healthy modding ecosystem while preserving the project’s identity, authorship, and official distribution channels. Community use, integration, and monetized participation through standard platform models are permitted as described below. All rights not expressly granted by this license remain reserved.

-----

## 1. Permitted Uses

### 1.1 Modpacks
Inclusion of the original, unmodified mod files in modpacks distributed through platforms such as CurseForge or Modrinth is permitted. Monetization through official platform reward programs is allowed. Runtime modifications, including mixins, datapacks, configuration changes, or compatibility layers, are permitted provided that the original mod files are not altered or redistributed in modified form, the project is not rebranded or misrepresented, and users obtain or load the original files from official distribution sources. Sharing official download links is permitted and encouraged.

### 1.2 Content Creation
Creation and monetization of videos, streams, tutorials, reviews, and similar content featuring the project is permitted. This includes revenue generated through advertisements, memberships, sponsorships, donations, or comparable platform features.

### 1.3 Servers
Use of the original, unmodified mod files on public or private servers is permitted. Standard server monetization models, including donations, cosmetic perks, access tiers, or community support systems, are allowed, provided that the mod itself is not sold separately and access to the mod is not independently paywalled.

### 1.4 Community Contributions
Forks, pull requests, issue reports, feature suggestions, and similar contributions intended to improve the official project are welcome. Public forks for development or experimentation are permitted, provided they are not distributed as independent releases or marketed as alternative versions of the project.

-----

## 2. Restrictions

To preserve project integrity and branding, the following actions are not permitted without explicit written authorization: redistribution of the mod files outside official distribution platforms; re-uploading project files to mirrors or alternative download hosts; distribution of modified versions of the original mod files, including altered JARs; rebranding the project or presenting modified versions as official releases; use of the project’s code, assets, or substantial design elements in standalone projects; and direct sale of the mod files, source code, or assets.

-----

## 3. Commercial Use

Commercial activity is permitted only within the scope defined in Section 1. Any commercial use beyond those permissions, including sublicensing, redistribution-based fundraising tied to modified distributions, partnerships involving derivative branded releases, or commercial derivative products, requires explicit written authorization.

-----

## 4. Source Code and Transparency

Source code may be publicly accessible to encourage transparency, learning, and collaborative development. Public availability does not grant rights to redistribute modified releases, relicense the project, create independent branded derivatives, or represent modified versions as official. All intellectual property rights remain with the original author.

-----

## 5. Branding and Identity

The project name, branding, visual identity, and associated materials remain the intellectual property of the original author. Add-ons, integrations, or compatibility modules must clearly distinguish themselves from the official project and must not imply endorsement without permission.
